abstract = {In this letter we discuss a least squares version for support vector machine (SVM) classi-fiers. Due to equality type constraints in the formulation, the solution follows from solving a set of linear equations, instead of quadratic programming for classical SVM's. The approach is illustrated on a two-spiral benchmark classification problem.},

@article{Yevs,
abstract = {We study the relationship between Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Least Squares SVM (LS-SVM). Our main result shows that under mild conditions, LS-SVM for binary-class classifications is equivalent to the hard margin SVM based on the well-known Maha-lanobis distance measure. We further study the asymptotics of the hard margin SVM when the data dimensionality tends to infinity with a fixed sample size. Using recently developed theory on the asymptotics of the distribution of the eigenvalues of the covari-ance matrix, we show that under mild conditions , the equivalence result holds for the traditional Euclidean distance measure. These equivalence results are further extended to the multi-class case. Experimental results confirm the presented theoretical analysis.},
